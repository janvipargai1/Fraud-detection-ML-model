# üïµÔ∏è Anomaly (Fraud) Detection using Logistic Regression

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent activities using machine learning. I used **Logistic Regression**, a powerful classification algorithm, to identify anomalies in the dataset. The goal was to build a simple yet effective fraud detection model by first exploring the data, cleaning it, and then applying a classification technique.

## üìå Project Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Checked data distribution and correlations
   - Handled class imbalance and missing values
   - Visualized key patterns using graphs and plots

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Feature scaling and encoding
   - Balanced the dataset (if needed)
   - Split the data into training and testing sets

3. **Model Building**:
   - Applied **Logistic Regression** for binary classification
   - Trained the model and evaluated performance using confusion matrix and classification metrics
